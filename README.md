# Algorithms
Tracking progress while self-studying from Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) for self-reference. This may also help others. I will also be learning to use GitHub for the first time.

## Structure
- **CLRS Solutions :** Solutions to some selected problems. Mostly algorithmic.
- **Store :** Collection of most of the algorithms learnt in the order of their appearance in the book.
